Directory to savefile (Windows):
%localappdata%/crosscode/

choose cc.save

When you're done, click the arrow pointing to the left
to download the new savefile and replace the original savefile.

I can't guarantee that the editor will work 100% of the time.
So make a backup of your savefile before you replace it.
